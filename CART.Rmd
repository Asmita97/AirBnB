## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/ninad/Documents/DMPA HW")
df4 <- read.csv("C:/Users/ninad/Documents/DMPA HW/clean5.csv")

df4$host_response_time<-factor(df4$host_response_time, levels = c(levels(df4$host_response_time), NA), labels = c(levels(df4$host_response_time), "Not Specified"), exclude = NULL)

x <- c( "price",  "availability_365","state", "minimum_nights", "no_of_amenities", "cleaning_fee", "host_response_time", "host_total_listings_count", "no_of_verifications", "extra_people", "accommodates","host_is_superhost", "instant_bookable", "guests_included", "host_response_rate","cancellation_policy", "beds", "property_type")




y<-"high_booking_rate"
x1<-c(x,"high_booking_rate")
df4<-df4[x1]


df4<-df4 %>% drop_na()


str(df4)

set.seed(12345)
train <- sample(nrow(df4),0.7*nrow(df4))
df4_train <- df4[train,]
df4_test <- df4[-train,]

summary(df4_train$high_booking_rate)



tree.high_booking_rate=tree(as.factor(high_booking_rate)~.,data=df4_train)
summary(tree.high_booking_rate)
plot(tree.high_booking_rate)
text(tree.high_booking_rate,pretty=0)
tree.pred=predict(tree.high_booking_rate,df4_test, type="class")


confusion = table(tree.pred,df4_test$high_booking_rate)
confusion
Accuracy = (confusion[1,1]+confusion[2,2])/sum(confusion)
